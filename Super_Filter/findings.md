Super Filter is positioned as an all-in-one filtering solution that combines advanced date, categorical, and measure filters. It offers a comprehensive set of filtering capabilities that would typically require multiple custom visuals.

The documentation specifically mentions that there are over 39 custom visuals in Microsoft AppSource serving filtering and calendar view needs, but none of them cover the breadth of filtering possibilities that Inforiver Super Filter provides.
