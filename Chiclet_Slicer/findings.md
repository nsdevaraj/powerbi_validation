# Chiclet Slicer Feature Validation Findings

## Overview

Chiclet Slicer is a PowerBI custom visual that displays image and/or text buttons that act as an in-canvas filter. It was inspired by the slicer control found in Excel since 2010, but with much greater customization options. Chiclet slicers can be arranged horizontally for efficient real estate use, or as a matrix for a super compact form. They also support cross highlighting and can contain images.
