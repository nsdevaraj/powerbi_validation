# Autocomplete Filter Feature Validation Findings

## Overview

Autocomplete Filter (BI-Champ Suite) is a rich text filter that allows search, autocompletion, copy-and-paste list support, and much more. It is designed to help users efficiently search for values in text fields using autocompletion technology, which predicts possible matches as the user types letters within an identifier, word, code, phrase, or other text.

## Feature Support Summary

Based on the original matrix and validation against official documentation:

- Total features: 128
- Features supported (y): 15
- Features not supported (n): 58
- Features with no data (NaN): 55

## Key Features Confirmed

The following key features were explicitly confirmed in the documentation:

1. **Alphanumeric filter** - Allows filtering using text fields
2. **Alphanumeric search + Wildcard** - Supports wildcard search and partial matches
3. **Search (with suggestion)** - Provides autocompletion suggestions as you type
4. **Word Splitting** - Handles text intelligently with options for case-insensitive, diacritic-insensitive, etc.
5. **Single/Multi-select** - Allows selection of multiple filter values
6. **Sorting** - Control sorting of the pick list
7. **Sync Slicer** - Can be synchronized with other slicers
8. **Theme/Templates** - Various font and color overrides are possible
9. **Operator - (AND/OR)** - Supports logical operators for complex filtering

## Features Not Supported

According to the matrix, the Autocomplete Filter does not support many calendar-related and advanced filtering features. This aligns with the documentation which shows Autocomplete Filter is focused specifically on text-based filtering with autocompletion.

Some notable features not supported include:

- Calendar and date-related filtering features
- Slider-based filtering
- Progress Bar
- Observer Mode
- Tooltip functionality

## Validation Notes

The AppSource documentation mentions that the Autocomplete Filter has "nearly 100 settings" that control behavior and formatting, which suggests extensive customization capabilities. However, these are focused on text filtering rather than the full range of filtering capabilities covered in the feature matrix.

The documentation specifically highlights these capabilities:
- Autocompletion based on matches found
- Multiple search terms (exact or wildcard)
- Case-insensitive, diacritic-insensitive, punctuation-insensitive, whitespace-insensitive searching
- Fuzzy matching algorithms
- Control over completion list placement
- Secondary value display in suggestion list
- Copy-and-paste functionality for filter values

## Conclusion

Based on the validation against official documentation, the feature support claims in the matrix for Autocomplete Filter appear to be accurate. The visual supports text-based filtering with extensive autocompletion capabilities as indicated in the matrix, while not supporting many calendar-related and other specialized filtering features.
