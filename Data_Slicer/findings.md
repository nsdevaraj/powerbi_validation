# Data Slicer Feature Validation Findings

## Overview

Data Slicer is a PowerBI custom visual developed by SCvation that simplifies data filtering. It provides bulk-insert functionality, allowing users to efficiently filter their reports and refine datasets in Power BI. The visual offers two different operation modes (Text box and Interval) and features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Validation Sources

1. [SCvation Documentation - Data Slicer](https://scvation.com/data-slicer-documentation-power-bi/)

## Feature Support Summary

Based on the original matrix and validation against official documentation:

- Total features: 128
- Features supported (y): 14
- Features not supported (n): 107
- Features with no data (NaN): 7

## Key Features Confirmed

The following key features were explicitly confirmed in the documentation:

1. **Text box mode** - Allows users to input multiple values (up to 30,000) directly into a text box with copy-paste functionality
2. **Interval mode** - Enables users to define a range by setting minimum and maximum values for numeric, date, and text-based filtering
3. **Observer Mode/Highlighted Frame** - Visually indicates unapplied changes in the filter
4. **Operator (AND/OR)** - Supports logical operators for filtering
5. **Search with suggestion** - Provides search functionality with suggestions
6. **Search with regex/wildcard/operator** - Supports advanced search capabilities
7. **Quick menu** - Allows users to change delimiter and operator settings in reading view
8. **Tooltips** - Provides informational tooltips

## Features Not Supported

According to the matrix, Data Slicer does not support many calendar-specific features, which aligns with its purpose as a general data filtering tool rather than a calendar visualization. It also lacks advanced selection mechanisms like sliders and radio buttons, focusing instead on text-based and interval-based filtering.

## Validation Notes

The SCvation documentation provides detailed information about the visual's capabilities:

- The visual has a single dropzone called "Field" that accepts only a single data field (column, not measure)
- Text box mode is designed for handling large datasets with up to 30,000 values
- Interval mode supports numeric, date, and text-based filtering
- The quick menu provides flexibility to change delimiter and operator settings in reading view
- The visual features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- It supports multilingual Power BI reports

## Conclusion

Based on the validation against official documentation, the feature support claims in the matrix for Data Slicer appear to be accurate. The visual supports 14 features as indicated in the matrix, with a focus on efficient data filtering through bulk-insert functionality and interval-based filtering. The documentation confirms the presence of key features like multiple operation modes, observer mode, and advanced search capabilities.
