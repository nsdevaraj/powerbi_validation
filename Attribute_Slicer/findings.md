# Attribute Slicer Feature Validation Findings

## Overview

Attribute Slicer is a PowerBI custom visual developed by Microsoft that lets you filter a dataset on a given column by selecting attribute values of interest. It provides a helpful overview that lists the most common values first and shows the overall distribution of values as a horizontal bar chart.

## Feature Support Summary

Based on the original matrix and validation against official documentation:

- Total features: 128
- Features supported (y): 12
- Features not supported (n): 116

## Key Features Confirmed

The following key features were explicitly confirmed in the documentation:

1. **Alphanumeric filter** - Allows filtering a dataset on a given column by selecting attribute values
2. **Search (with suggestion)** - Ability to search for values in the slicer
3. **Values (Numbers/Measures) Display** - Can display measure values alongside filter selections
4. **Observer Mode** - Shows applied filters in a separate section
5. **Horizontal/Vertical Layout** - Can be displayed either vertically or horizontally
6. **Brush Mode** - Allows dragging to select multiple values at once
7. **Single/Multi-select** - Can be configured for single or multiple value selection

## Features Not Supported

According to the matrix, the Attribute Slicer does not support many advanced filtering features that are available in other visuals like Super Filter. This aligns with the documentation which shows Attribute Slicer has more limited functionality focused on its core purpose of attribute-based filtering.

Some notable features not supported include:

- Calendar and date-related filtering features
- Advanced search capabilities like wildcard search
- Hierarchical filtering
- Slider-based filtering
- Conditional formatting

## Validation Notes

The GitHub repository notes that "This visual is experimental and not actively being developed, only major issues will be addressed." This explains the limited feature set compared to more actively developed visuals like Super Filter.

The Pragmatic Works blog confirms several key features including:
- Ability to filter a dataset on selected values
- Display of measure values associated with each attribute
- Vertical or horizontal orientation options
- Search functionality
- Single or multi-select options
- Brush mode for selecting multiple values

## Conclusion

Based on the validation against official documentation, the feature support claims in the matrix for Attribute Slicer appear to be accurate. The visual supports a limited set of core filtering capabilities as indicated in the matrix, with most advanced features marked as not supported.
